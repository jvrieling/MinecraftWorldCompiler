# MinecraftWorldCompiler
A tool to 'compile' Minecraft worlds to prepare them for publishing to websites.

Arguments: <level.dat file path> <player x> <player y> <player z> <player pitch> <player yaw> <player game type>

The script also restores the default player's score, food/saturation, and XP.

I also reccomend NBTExplorer if you want to edit level.dat files. Super handy!

##Sample compile command
See 'compile.bat' for a sample of the command to run the compiler. This bat file should be placed in the world folder (i.e. next to level.dat)
